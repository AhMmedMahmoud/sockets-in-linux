"0.0.0.0" 
    - called "wildcard" or "any" address.
  
    - special IP address is used to make the socket able to listen incoming connections from any IP address 
    that the machine is associated with, whether it's a local address, a LAN address, or a public address.
  
    - given to the server only as you cannot bind a server socket to a specific client address.
    because the server socket is responsible for accepting connections from multiple clients, not just a single client.
    The client address is determined dynamically when a client connects to the server socket.
        
        - If you want to restrict the server to only accept connections from specific clients,
        you would need to implement that logic within your server application. After accepting a connection,
        you can check the client address and decide whether to continue processing the connection or
        reject it based on your specific criteria.



"127.0.0.1"
    - called "loopback" or "localhost" address.
  
    - special IP address is used to bind the socket to the loopback interface of the machine.
    (a standard feature provided by network stack on operating system) that allows communication within the same machine.

    - special IP address is used to make the socket able to only accept connections originating from the same machine.

    - given to client or server to allow communication within the same machine.
